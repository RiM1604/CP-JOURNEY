# CP-JOURNEY
This repo contains all the questions solved till date practicing for Competitive programming and also contains some insights that i learned during this grind.

## Usage

You need to copy the snippets.json into your user snippets in VS code.

Each time before coding simply type `CP-main`  in main.cpp file and the competitive template will appear, now you can start coding.

You simply need to write the code in `main.cpp` file and use the short cut ``Ctrl + Shift + B``  to compile the code.

On successful compilation all you need to is
- write the metadata about the code in the comments in the start of the file,
- save the code in a file within the ``QUESTIONS`` folder with a desired name.

Once this is done then after every 2 hours all your modified and untracked  C++ files will be pushed to remote and also all the gist for the question will be stored in a folder called  `HISTORY` in a file with the current month and year as name.
