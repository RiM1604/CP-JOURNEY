03-07-2024,20:02:22,20:31:07,28 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1679,Easy,Find the order in which you need to do courses give prerequisites,Yes,"Finding the round trip in a directed graph is different than in a undirected graph, using stack in directed to keep track of the nodes we have rn."
03-07-2024,20:51:02,23:19:26,148 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1680/,Medium,Find the longest path from 1 to n,Yes,"Used dp here to do max distance by building the dp from n to 1, note that using par[] method is diff from child[] method cause par[v]=ans[i-1] you cant be sure that the parent is of the largest path, but for child[ans[i-1]]=v you can be sure of that as you know the max val is for which child."
05-07-2024,22:45:37,23:48:23,62 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1130,Easy,Find the matching i.e the edges give a tree.,Yes,Simple observation that do matching starting from the leaf nodes which is always optimal. Forgot to do g[a].pb(b) and g[b].pb(a) and did g[a].pb(b) but its wrong as it is undirected.
07-07-2024,09:58:00,14:00:53,242 minutes,https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_s,Medium,Find the number of integers in between 1 and K which are divisible by D,Yes,Learnt to write the code for digit dp for this sum using only one right tightness. Did mistake of changing rem and passing it in the next recursion.
07-07-2024,18:23:09,10:45:59,-457 minutes,https://codeforces.com/contest/429/problem/A,Easy,Find the min no of flips where when you flip the node which you take its child flips but the child's child does not and the child's child's child flips.,Yes,Did mistake of understanding the question wrong and worked out the wrong solution which passed the first test case somehow.
