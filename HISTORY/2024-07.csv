03-07-2024,20:02:22,20:31:07,28 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1679,Easy,Find the order in which you need to do courses give prerequisites,Yes,"Finding the round trip in a directed graph is different than in a undirected graph, using stack in directed to keep track of the nodes we have rn."
03-07-2024,20:51:02,23:19:26,148 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1680/,Medium,Find the longest path from 1 to n,Yes,"Used dp here to do max distance by building the dp from n to 1, note that using par[] method is diff from child[] method cause par[v]=ans[i-1] you cant be sure that the parent is of the largest path, but for child[ans[i-1]]=v you can be sure of that as you know the max val is for which child."
05-07-2024,22:45:37,23:48:23,62 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1130,Easy,Find the matching i.e the edges give a tree.,Yes,Simple observation that do matching starting from the leaf nodes which is always optimal. Forgot to do g[a].pb(b) and g[b].pb(a) and did g[a].pb(b) but its wrong as it is undirected.
07-07-2024,09:58:00,14:00:53,242 minutes,https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_s,Medium,Find the number of integers in between 1 and K which are divisible by D,Yes,Learnt to write the code for digit dp for this sum using only one right tightness. Did mistake of changing rem and passing it in the next recursion.
07-07-2024,18:23:09,10:45:59,-457 minutes,https://codeforces.com/contest/429/problem/A,Easy,Find the min no of flips where when you flip the node which you take its child flips but the child's child does not and the child's child's child flips.,Yes,Did mistake of understanding the question wrong and worked out the wrong solution which passed the first test case somehow.
08-07-2024,11:10:41,14:32:30,201 minutes,https://codeforces.com/contest/1983/problem/C,Easy to Medium,"Find ranges la,ra,lb,rb,lc,rc from given three arrays a,b,c which have sum >= upper_ceil(tot/3) in O(n);",Yes,Did a very brute force application and made mistakes in changing the starting points and the arrays to calculate in
09-07-2024,00:18:12,11:59:48,701 minutes,https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/goc-cdc-series-31/challenges/shashwat-and-grid/problem,Easy to Medium,Find the maximum no of leaves you can collect in x time without stepping on minesweepers.,Yes,Simple dfs approach but slight changes. Using marked[] to keep track if the leaf in the current node is taken or not and setting marked[]=0 before returning the ans if we collect the leaf in the current node else dont because it will override the previous choice regarding that node. and setting the ans = INT_MIN if the choices ahead are not possible.
09-07-2024,13:29:03,15:11:26,102 minutes,https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/goc-cdc-series-31/challenges,Medium,"Find the min distance to x,y if you can only go to a neighbour (a,b)if its distance is equal to d.",Yes,The number of right angled triangles with integer sides given a hypotenuse d is very less it is less than O(d) and close to O(1) i think.
11-07-2024,12:45:16,,,https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-students-taking-exam/description/,Medium to Hard,Find the maximum no of students you can seat given a restriction.,Yes,Learnt about using dp profile method in bitmask dp where you store a section of the previous choices which effect the current choice.
11-07-2024,14:12:16,,,https://leetcode.com/problems/matchsticks-to-square/,Hard,k-subset sum paritioning where k=4,Yes,"here reverse sorting the matchsticks array helps in reducing the time complexity because it takes lesser steps than sorted in increasing order to reach a backtracking point where one of the sum's of a,b,c,d becomes > target."
12-07-2024,17:56:46,19:03:19,66 minutes,https://codeforces.com/contest/1857/problem/G,2000,Find the number of graphs which has mst equal to the given one,No,Idea here was to sort edges based on weight and process from the starting so that we are sure that the current edge is the highest weighted edge.
13-07-2024,13:15:14,13:36:27,21 minutes,https://codeforces.com/contest/1830/problem/A,Medium,output the number of readings Copil Copac needs to draw the tree.,Yes,idea is to do dfs along with a helping array and using previously calcualted answers to get the answer for the next node.
