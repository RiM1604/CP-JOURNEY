11-06-2024,14:15:11,14:16:57,1 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1673,Easy,CSES problem,Yes,"If there is a cycle in a directed graph it is not guaranteed to have infinite max distance, in this case for it to be infinite the cycle should be reachable from 1 and  you should be able to reach n from the cycle."
11-06-2024,17:40:15,18:00:12,19 minutes,...,Easy,AZ Problem,Yes,Did mistake of doing rank change and parent change on x and y instead of find(x) and find(y) should be careful to remember that x is represented by find(x)
