02-06-2024,09:47:34,10:07:24,19 minutes,https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc356/tasks/abc356_d,Hard,find the sum of set bits in (i & m) for all i <= n,ofc not,counting the number of set bits in i-th index for all numbers <= N
11-06-2024,14:15:11,14:16:57,1 minutes,https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1673,Easy,CSES problem,Yes,"If there is a cycle in a directed graph it is not guaranteed to have infinite max distance, in this case for it to be infinite the cycle should be reachable from 1 and  you should be able to reach n from the cycle."
11-06-2024,17:40:15,18:00:12,19 minutes,...,Easy,AZ Problem,Yes,Did mistake of doing rank change and parent change on x and y instead of find(x) and find(y) should be careful to remember that x is represented by find(x)
11-06-2024,18:07:11,18:47:25,40 minutes,....,Easy,AZ problem,Yes,Using marked to keep track of non deleted edges and adding them using unionfind before starting the queries from the reverse order.11-06-2024,18:07:11,18:47:25,40 minutes,....,Easy,AZ problem,Yes,Using marked to keep track of non deleted edges and adding them using unionfind before starting the queries from the reverse order.
11-06-2024,19:16:12,20:14:00,57 minutes,..,Medium,AZ problem,Yes,Still forgot again that for getting rank you need to do find(x) for rank.
11-06-2024,23:45:48,00:30:46,-1395 minutes,https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/goc-cdc-series-27/challenges/travellers-troubles,Medium,Travellers Troubles to find shortest path between x and y if one edge has its wt set to zero and made bidirectional,Yes,"If in a DG a shortest path exists in forward direction then the same path is the shortest for the reversed graph in the opposite direction, Idea here was to find the shortest distance to vertex y from i using reverse graph and doing dijkstra on y."
12-06-2024,15:44:06,16:32:41,48 minutes,In PC,Medium,Doing weighted Union Find,Yes,"We can keep difference between two ax, ay as and edge and do union find where in merge we need to do dfs to update the ranks of the smaller tree in the merge operation which on all the operations take O(n). Here we dont consolidate the graph on find."
12-06-2024,16:39:27,17:47:54,68 minutes,In PC,Easy,Find Diameter of Tree,Yes,Simple diameter code using 2 bfs calls
12-06-2024,18:02:04,18:41:54,39 minutes,In PC,Easy,Finding the no of diameters in case of single center and two centers,Yes,Keep track of how many nodes at distance len/2 in subtree[] using dfs. Took time to debug the code and dont be too scared to write the total code sometimes.
12-06-2024,16:39:27,17:03:01,23 minutes,In PC,Easy,Find Center of Tree,Yes,You need to find path to get the center.
